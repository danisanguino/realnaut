# Realnaut Build Plugin

This project provides a responsive menu with submenus, implemented as a plugin. It uses Webpack for bundling, SASS for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for functionality. The build process compiles everything into the `dist` folder, which is then used for plugin integration.

## Process
1. **Set Up**: Install dependencies and configure Webpack using `npm install`.
2. **Develop**: Build the menu and submenu structure.
3. **Run Locally**: Start the development server with `npm start`.
4. **Compile**: Build the final assets with `npm run build` to generate the `dist` folder.

## Technologies Used
- Webpack
- SASS
- Vanilla JavaScript
